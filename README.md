# Agile-Project.Fafrak
Class project 
#Project Charter 
This projects main purpose is the application of the principles of the Agile methodology and Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to develop and execute a  software solution over the span of two sprints. This project is giing to have a heavy emphasis on adaptability, iterative planning,continuous improvement, as well as teamwork. As a result of follwing the Agile approach, the set goal is simulation of a software development environment based in reality where feedback and iteration drive progress instead of up front, rigid design.  The primary objective of this project is to provide a demonstration that helps to understand  backlog creation, project planning, GitHub-based version control and sprint scheduling. Deliverables are going to include an application that is functioning as well as documentation supporting whst is reflective of  Agile practices that are effective. 
#Stakeholders: Kenneth Fafrak: Responsibilities include: Ensuring value of business, ensuring backlog items are prioritized and definition of features.
Developer: Responsibilities include: Integration of components, teating, designing and programming. 
Scrum Master: Responsibilities include: Enduring operations are smooth, retrospectives, as well as moderating of sprint planning. 
#Risks: 
Technology: Factors outside of control auch as outage or errors, experiencing learning curves, and effective decision making. 
Time management: Ensuring everything is done at the planned time and working around errors, personal life, and any other unexpected factors. 
Miscommunication: Not reading instructions and/or criteria correctly. 
Scope creep: Addition of components that are outside the agreed upon criteria. 
Quality Assurance: The final version should be free of bugs, kinks, and/or any other hindrance to the success of the project. 
#Success Criteria: 
Each sprint executed well with retrospectives properly recorded. 
Completion of all user stories with acceptance criteria that is properly defined. 
Complete organization of repository with version control practices and documemtation that is adequate. 
Application that is fully functioning and free of bugs that meets all criteria. 
Agile Principles being evident with iteration, reflection, as well as adaptability being present. 
#Sprint Plan 
Weeks 2-4: Completion of Charter, Github Configuration, Project Setup, Feature Design and implementation, finalization of project charter, completion of initial features. 
Weeks 5-7: Perform testing, complete excess user stories, documentation updates, preparation of final deliverables, and a bugless working prototype.

#Trends Note: 
In the past, Waterfall was the go to for developing. Currently, DevOp is the standard. In the future, AI will assist with coding and and debugging and testing will be automated.
